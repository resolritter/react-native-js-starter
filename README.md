Project bootstrapped by [react-native-cli](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

Following are the key differences from the barebones template:

- Different `.prettierrc`.
- Primed for navigation with `react-navigation-stack` (minimal working example included).
- `MainActivity.java` has been modified to showcase how to interact with intent data on launch.
- `metro.config.js` has been tweaked for allowing root imports from the `src`
folder, a pattern which better matches web React applications.
